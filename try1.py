    Parrot trouble
    We have a loud talking parrot. 
    The "hour" value is the current hour time in the range 0..23. 
    We are in trouble if the parrot is talking and the hour is before 7 or after 20. 
    Return True if we are in trouble.
    note, military time: midnight = 0, then 1,2,3,...,11,12,13,14,15...
